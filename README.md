# Work in Progress - Use at your own risk!

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/vuejs/vue-router/master.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/vuejs/vue-router)

### Notes

1. `vue-router` only supports Vue 0.12+.

2. No docs yet. Check out [`/example`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/tree/master/example) for example usage.

3. Files in `/dist` are out of date. If you are not using Browserify or Webpack you'd have to build the standalone file yourself until an official release is out.

### Build

``` bash
npm install
npm run build
```
